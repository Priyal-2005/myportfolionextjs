          <h4>Student Entrepreneur & AI Enthusiast</h4>
          <p>I am passionate about Programming, AI, and solving real-life problems. I founded a startup that helps photographers and newlyweds. I'm a TiE prototype 
          competition winner and have explored idea validation through IIT & Wadhwani. My AI project for loan prediction won me an LoR from HPE. I co-founded Coding Champs and taught Python to kids. I was the youngest IIIT-H certified pedagogy teacher and donated 50% of my teaching earnings to PM CARE FUND. I enjoy participating in business and innovation competitions, including one by Tiger Global. Beyond tech, I love modelling and creative exploration! 
          I have technical skills in Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and DSA.</p>
